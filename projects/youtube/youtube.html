          As a creator, I’ve always struggled to figure out which of my videos
          were truly performing well. Views alone are misleading—what about
          engagement? What about recency? A video with 1M views might seem
          successful, but if it’s 5 years old and has no likes or comments, is
          it really helping my channel grow?
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I needed a way to identify <strong>outliers</strong>—videos that were
          truly exceptional in terms of engagement, views, and relevance. But
          manually analyzing every video was time-consuming and inaccurate. I
          knew there had to be a better way.

          YouTube analytics can be overwhelming—views alone don’t tell the full
          story.

          That’s why I built the <strong>YouTube Outlier App</strong>. I
          leveraged artificial intelligence to develop a web app that analyzes
          your videos and scores them based on views, likes, comments, and
          recency. The problem, ideation, and solution came from my own
          struggles as a creator. This app is built by a creator, for creators.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The app lets you choose between Popularity, Engagement, or Balanced
          scoring to align with your goals. It also adjusts for recency, so
          older videos don’t unfairly dominate your rankings. Using Z-scores, it
          identifies videos that are statistically significant outliers—helping
          you focus on what truly matters.
